# MRC CBU PYTHON MEG WRAPPER
#
# This library is intended to allow for easy communication between our
# experiment and the MEG setup at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit.
# It is based on the MATLAB class for doing the same thing by Tibor Auer and
# Johan Carlin (https://github.com/MRC-CBU/megsync/blob/master/MEGSynchClass.m)
# The implementation is intended for the CBU setup only, and uses the custom
# National Instruments setup in the MEG lab.
